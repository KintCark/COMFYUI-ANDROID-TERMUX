Animatediff Works only on 12gb Ram and Up.
Animatediff lcm is best cause it's required less steps,make sure u pick the animate lcm lora and animate lcm checpoint!,or you will have burnt images
I figured this after struggling with 3 videos üòÅüòÇ
useing an lcm model is even better for higher quality videos.

I just Discovered The Best Args Combination you can use SDXL AND LORAS!!! It's 16 seconds per Step!! 50 seconds for 512x320!!! XD it's BLAZING FAST!!!

if u wanna use animatediff u have to change the text-enc and unet to fp16 fp8 works best for sdxl.


SDXL/SD3

cd ComfyUI && python main.py  --cpu --disable-xformers --preview-method taesd --cpu-vae --disable-cuda-malloc --use-split-cross-attention --disable-metadata --force-fp16 --fp8_e4m3fn-text-enc --fp8_e4m3fn-unet --dont-upcast-attention

SD1.5 ANIMATEDIFF 

cd ComfyUI && python main.py --cpu --preview-method taesd --cpu-vae --disable-cuda-malloc --use-split-cross-attention --disable-metadata --force-fp16 --fp16-unet --fp16-text-enc

Install ComfyUI Manager

cd ComfyUI

cd custom_nodes

git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git


After You install Manager Make Sure To Install Efficiency Nodes!! they are better for Performance And are less messy!!! Also install Rgthree's nodes they have an optimized feature that helps load sdxl models.

SD3 clip included Model Works its only 5gb and makes stunning portraits in 6-7 steps. it took an hour to make 7 steps but that's fine with me. don't use the sd3 t5xxl version as it's 10gb and won't work cause the sd3 base model is too big. t5xxl only works with sd1.5 cause it's only 2gb size.12gb ram is required but if u have s phone with more ram ull be able to use sd3 with t5xxl included. üòâ 

u can make 512x512 and 256x256 images they are alot faster especially 256x256
